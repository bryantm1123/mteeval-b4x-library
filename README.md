#B4X Expression Compiler and Eval Library

MteEval is a library for compiling and evaluating expressions at runtime. Expressions are converted to bytecode and then executed on demand with a simple virtual machine.

There are three builds of the library available: B4A (Android), B4i (iOS), and B4J (Java)

##Usage

MteEval adopts the "code block" format from the venerable 1990's xBase compiler Clipper 5.X.

**{|<parameters,>|<expression>}
